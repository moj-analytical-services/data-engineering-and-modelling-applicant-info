## Who are we

Welcome. 

Data Engineers and Data Modellers within the Ministry of Justice’s Data and Analysis division work across two teams, one which delivers solutions to internal stakeholder needs across the organisation (DMET), and another that works on a cutting-edge data platform (Data Platform). We have a section below on what the difference is between the two teams.

As a Data Engineer or Modeller in our team you will get the opportunity to continue to build your coding skills, as well as develop new and exciting cloud computing capabilities using Amazon Web Service (AWS). We don’t just focus on developing technical skills though. You will also gain experience working directly with stakeholders to deliver important solutions to key Ministry of Justice needs. You won’t be alone either. As well as being part of a growing team within DMET or Data Platform, you will also be part of a large analytical community at the Ministry of Justice and use your expertise to shape the future of how data is used in decision making.

#### What does a Data Engineer do?

At all levels, our Data Engineers design and develop robust data pipelines so that data can be transformed into a form that Ministry of Justice Data Scientists and Analysts can use. They are also responsible for managing data access to the Ministry of Justice’s Analytical Platform.  Data Engineers will also be expected to directly work alongside key departments within the Ministry of Justice, and be able to explain technical solutions in non-technical ways.

#### What does a Data Modeller do?

At all levels, our Data Modellers work with the end users of data to understand their requirements and needs. They will translate conceptual data model designs into computer code to deliver data to the end user. They will also analyse the quality of the data and communicate their findings to data owners so improvements can be made.


### Our structure

#### Data Engineering and Modelling Team (DMET)

The Data Modelling and Engineering team works across several areas of the Ministry of Justice to define, design, and deliver Data Engineering and Data Modelling as a service. These areas include Probation, Prisons, Criminal Courts, Civil and Family Courts, Counterterrorism, the Office for Public Guardian, and Corporate. We also have cross-cutting areas such as Data First and BOLD, as well as a Service Management team who helps technical leads engage and work with stakeholders.

#### Digital Platform


## Our work

### Analytical Platform

The Analytical Platform (AP) provides access to recent versions of open–source analytical software, such as RStudio and JupyterLab, allowing analysts to work in the way that suits them best. [Find out more information about the Analytical Platform here](https://user-guidance.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/)

### Analytical Platform Tools

The team has developed a number of Python and R tools for users on the Analytical Platform. This includes [pydbtools](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/pydbtools), which is a package for querying MoJAP athena databases with useful features including temp table creation, and [Create a Derived Table](https://user-guidance.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/tools/create-a-derived-table/), a tool for creating persistent derived tables in Athena.

### Splink

[splink](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink) is a Python package for probabilistic record linkage (entity resolution).
